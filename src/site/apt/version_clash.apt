Version Clash

  On this page we will give you a quick introduction about the Maven dependency mediation and
  show you how we defined Maven dependency version clashes.

  First of all it is important to know that Maven always uses the version of the closest dependency to your project in
  the tree of dependencies and not necessarily the highest version! Maven defines this as the <<"nearest definition">> which
  is the only available dependency mediation since Maven 2.0.9. For details visit the official Maven page
  {{{http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html}Introduction to the Dependency Mechanism}}.

  Following examples will help you to understand how this dependency mediation can lead to <<<CRITICAL>>>, <<<UNSAFE>>> or <<<SAFE>>> conditions.

* Example 1: Critical

[../../src/site/resources/images/CRITICAL.png] Critical

  \
  Assume you have a <<<testproject:1.0>>> which has dependencies on <<<com.google.guava:guava:13.0.1>>> and on
  <<<dependency:1.0>>>. <<<dependency:1.0>>> has a dependency on <<<com.google.guava:guava:14.0.1>>>. As mentioned before, Maven will use the closest dependency in the tree
  which is <<<com.google.guava:guava:13.0.1>>>, the lower version. In this case all changes from version <<<13.0.1>>> to <<<14.0.1>>> will  be lost.
  If <<<dependency:1.0>>> is using a class or a method which only exists in version <<<14.0.1>>> there will be problems. We call this a critical condition or a critical version clash.

* Example 2: Unsafe

[../../src/site/resources/images/UNSAFE.png] Unsafe

  \
  Assume the closest dependency of <<<com.google.guava:guava>>> in the tree has the version <<<14.0.1>>> (used version) and <<<dependency:1.0>>> uses a lower version <<<13.0.1>>>.
  We define this case as an unsafe condition or an unsafe version clash. Imagine <<<dependency:1.0>>> uses a deprecated class or method which was deleted from
  version <<<13.0.1>>> to <<<14.0.1>>> it would also lead to problems.


* Example 3: Safe

[../../src/site/resources/images/SAFE.png] Safe

  \
  We have a safe condition, if all versions of an artifact in the tree are the same.
